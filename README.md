# CapStoneAdventure
This is a personal project that I started in early December. It's a Text Based RPG using C#.NET Windows Forms.
In it's current form it wouldn't be a publishable game, merely a prof of concept for myself.

It uses two solution one for the UI and one for the game engine, this allows the engine to be easily imported into another project and I could trim what wasn't needed.
